# SQL Data Warehouse Project 🏢📊  
*Building a modern data warehouse using SQL Server — including ETL processes, Data Modeling, and Analytics*

---

## 🌟 Welcome!
Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository!** 🚀  
This project demonstrates a **comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution**, covering the full lifecycle from **data ingestion** to **actionable insights**.  

Designed as a **portfolio project**, it follows **industry best practices** in **data engineering, SQL development, and analytics**.

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture
The architecture follows the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers):

- **🥉 Bronze Layer**  
  Raw data ingested from **CSV files** into a SQL Server database, stored *as-is* from source systems.

- **🥈 Silver Layer**  
  Data cleansing, standardization, and normalization take place here, preparing data for analytics.

- **🥇 Gold Layer**  
  Business-ready, **star schema modeled data** designed for **reporting and advanced analytics**.
